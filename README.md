# AMP Predictor
## Backstory
In a beautiful world where no evil was present, suddenly a big wicked antibiotic resistance came. The world changed and there was no savior...

Until a little peptide appeared. And not just one but quite a few came to fight with the Resistance. These antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), invisible for human eyes, shine in the darkness and need our help.
Only together we can defeat the Resistance and make the world better again.

## Decription
This is a bachelor project where I intend to predict potencial AMPs using ML and data from AMPSphere.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by an [article][1] about recently published database [AMPSphere][2].
